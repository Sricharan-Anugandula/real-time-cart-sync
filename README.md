##  Real-Time Cart Sync (Angular 20 + .NET 8)

This repository demonstrates a **real-time shopping cart implementation** using:

* **Angular 20** with the new `@for` directive
* **.NET 8 Web API** with proper CORS configuration and clean architecture

>  This idea came from a recent interview question. I built and open-sourced it to help others who may face similar scenarios.

---

###  Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Angular 20+ (`@for`, standalone components)
* **Backend**: ASP.NET 8 Web API
* **Data Layer**: In-memory cart service for simplicity
* **Dev Features**: CORS support, modular project structure
